Update: February 25, 2022

Added a .webloc file. You can download and open it, and it will take you
to my Docker Hub page, where you'll find the web and database images to
test my ETH application. You can simply pull those into any code application
and you'll have the application running at: localhost:3000 !

Enjoy :)
